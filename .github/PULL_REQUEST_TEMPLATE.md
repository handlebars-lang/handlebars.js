Before creating a pull-request, please check https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md first.

Generally we like to see pull requests that

- [ ] Maintain the existing code style
- [ ] Are focused on a single change (i.e. avoid large refactoring or style adjustments in untouched code if not the primary goal of the pull request)
- [ ] Have good commit messages
- [ ] Have tests
- [ ] Don't significantly decrease the current code coverage (see coverage/lcov-report/index.html)
