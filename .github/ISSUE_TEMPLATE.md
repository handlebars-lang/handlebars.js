Before filing issues, please check the following points first:

- [ ] Have a look at https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Read the FAQ at https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/FAQ.md
- [ ] Use the jsfiddle-template at https://jsfiddle.net/9D88g/47/ to reproduce problems or bugs

This will probably help you to get a solution faster. 
For bugs, it would be great to have a PR with a failing test-case.
