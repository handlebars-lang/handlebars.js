Before filing issues, please check the following points first:

- [ ] Please don't open issues for security issues. Instead, file a report at https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/report?package=handlebars
- [ ] Have a look at https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Read the FAQ at https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/FAQ.md
- [ ] Use the jsfiddle-template at https://jsfiddle.net/4nbwjaqz/4/ to reproduce problems or bugs

This will probably help you to get a solution faster.
For bugs, it would be great to have a PR with a failing test-case.
