# This script tests with precompiler and the built distribution with multiple NodeJS version.
# The rest of the travis-build will only work with newer NodeJS versions, because the build
# tools don't support older versions.
# However, the built distribution should work with older NodeJS versions as well.
# This test is simple by design. It merely ensures, that calling Handlebars does not fail with old versions.
# It does (almost) not test for correctness, because that is already done in the mocha-tests.
# And it does not use any NodeJS based testing framwork to make this part independent of the Node version.
